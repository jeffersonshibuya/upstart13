# Getting Started

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
> 
> and [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create an API fake based on a json file.

## yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## yarn build

Builds the app for production to the **`build`** folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## yarn server
